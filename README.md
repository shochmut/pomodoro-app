# Pomodoro App

Built with React, Redux, and Material UI. This app allows for the user to set a timer for pomodoro sessions with breaks that occur subsequently after the session ends. Upon completion of the session and break the timer will loop back to session. The Timer also features an alarm sound that will go off upon completion of each cycle.
